Terraform Load Balancer with EFS Mount Template

This is a Terraform template that creates a load balancer with 2 servers using an EFS mount on /var/www/html. This template will create all the necessary resources to work. The load balancer's CNAME will be returned as an output.

Prerequisites
Terraform (version 1.4.4 or later)
- An AWS account with sufficient permissions to create the resources
- An existing VPC in the same region where you want to create the resources


Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.

change the VPC id in the next section:


# Retrieve the existing VPC
data "aws_vpc" "existing_vpc" {
  id = "vpc-076c009696d0b0000"
}


Initialize the Terraform working directory


terraform init


Review the resources that will be created

terraform plan


Create the resources

terraform apply



Once the resources have been created, the load balancer's CNAME will be outputted to the terminal. You can use this to access your website.

When you are done with the resources, you can destroy them:

terraform destroy
